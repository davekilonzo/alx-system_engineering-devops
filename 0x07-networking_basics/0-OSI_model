What is the OSI model? The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology. It’s not a set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect, nor does it characterize the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology.
How is the OSI model organized? The OSI model is organized from the lowest to the highest level. It’s not organized alphabetically or randomly. The lowest level (Layer 1) deals with physical aspects of data transmission, while the highest level (Layer 7) deals with application-specific communication
